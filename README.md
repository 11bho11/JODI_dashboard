# JODI Exploratory Dashboard        

This is a Dash (Plotly) interactive dashboard to view data from the JODI World Database, developed with Python.

The JODI (Joint Organisations Data Initiative) World database consists of oil & gas data for over 120 countries, with historical data dating back to Jan 2002. The goal of the database is to provide a transparent and reliable platform for oil & gas data. Learn more about the history of JODI [here](https://www.ief.org/jodi/history). 

Data frequency is monthly. The data feed is updated monthly, with a 2-3 month lag period. Find more about JODI release dates [here](https://www.jodidata.org/). 

## Why did I build this?

The world of commodities can be a very mysterious place, and data is king to making important decisions in the industry. There are only so many publicly available databases such as EIA, IEA, CFTC. I could not view JODI data unless I bulk-downloaded an Excel file with 10M+ rows. 

Luckily, I found out that the JODI was accessible for free via Nasdaq. However, both JODI and Nasdaq had no way to visualise data nicely, unlike the EIA which does a great job. Therefore, I built this exploratary dashboard which automatically pulls data via the Nasdaq Data Table API, making the platform smooth and light.


## Getting Started
The JODI World database is available via the Nasdaq Data Link Tables API for free. Check out more on Nasdaq's website [here](https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/JODI#:~:text=This%20database%20provides%20comprehensive%20and,from%20production%20to%20end%20use.)
