# JODI Exploratory Dashboard        

This is a Dash (Plotly) interactive dashboard to view data from the JODI World Database, developed with Python.

The JODI (Joint Organisations Data Initiative) World database consists of oil & gas data for over 50 countries, with historical data dating back to 2002. The goal of the database was to provide a transparent and reliable platform for oil & gas data. Learn more about the history of JODI [here](https://www.ief.org/jodi/history). 

Data is on a monthly frequency, which is released 2-3 months later. Find more about JODI release dates [here](https://www.jodidata.org/). 

## Why did I build this?

The world of commodities can be a very mysterious place, and data is king to making important decisions in the industry. There are only so many publicly available databases such as EIA, IEA, CFTC. I found out that the JODI was accessible for free via Nasdaq. 

Nevertheless, both JODI and Nasdaq had no platform to visualise data nicely, unlike the EIA which does a great job. Therefore, I built this exploratary dashboard which automatically pulls data via the Nasdaq API, making the platform more smooth and light.


## Getting Started
